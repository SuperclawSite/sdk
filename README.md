# 🦾 Super Claw

**Super Claw** is a personal AI assistant that grows with you over time.  
It remembers context, understands your preferences, and adapts to how *you* think—so every interaction becomes smarter, more personal, and more useful.

Unlike stateless chatbots, Super Claw is built for continuity.  
It’s not just answering questions—it’s supporting your long-term thinking, workflows, and decisions.
